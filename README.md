# Capturing_Motion
This was my second project using open-cv2, I have created a script able to detect motion within the webcams view

when using this, begin with a clear still background so opencv is able to create an idea of the room with 0 movement.

this is a very basic motion detector, therefore lighting and changes will effect the cameras ability to identify moving objects

this program is great for a base script, i would add features such as saving all motion occurrances (which i began but i have only began implementing this)

motion when detected will be drawn around similar to face detection, i have also implemented text and datetime into the video capture.
